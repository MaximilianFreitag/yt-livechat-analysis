### Current bugs: üêû

- When people are writing before the main stream started the minutes are counted as negative integers -4,-3,-2 ... this can lead to problems sometimes.    
- The web version is collecting the data for too long sometimes or even stops the script if you test out multiple URLs or if you re-run the code

### To-Do list: (Things that I want to add as a functionality)

- [ ] I want to add additional text boxes for the user to input custom words e.g. spam ... eggs that will be displayed in a sparate graph for the results. So the user sees "Oh, the word spam was mentioned 42 times in minute 33 and eggs was mentioned 7 times in minute 55".
- [ ] I want to add spacing for the mobile version. Currently just writing something like st.write('  ') or using line breaks like '<br> 'doesn't work for mobile, only for web 
- [ ] Add a giphy GIF for the loading state 
- [ ] Make the theme of the app white, currently it depends on the users settings if the app appears in light or dark mode. Adding a .config file changes that
